The Hospital Management System is a Command-Line-Interface application built in Java that allows patients, doctors, pharmacists, and administrators to interact with each other and perform tasks that a hospital may require, such as viewing medical records, scheduling appointments, and maintaining a billing system.

## Libraries Used

### jBCrypt

We used **jBCrypt** for secure password hashing and verification in our application. jBCrypt provides an implementation of the BCrypt hashing algorithm in Java, enhancing security by incorporating a salt and a computational cost factor to protect against brute-force attacks.

#### Installation

Since we didn't use Maven or any build automation tools, jBCrypt was added manually to the project.

**Download the Library**

- Download the `jbcrypt-0.4.jar` file from the official repository:
  - [Download jBCrypt 0.4](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mindrot/jbcrypt/0.4/jbcrypt-0.4.jar)
